#pushing container to docker hub remote repository
When you build them, using docker build -t <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>]
By re-tagging an existing local image 

docker ps #to find existing-images
docker tag <existing-image> <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>]

docker compose ps to find existing/ running containers
By using 
docker commit <existing-container> <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>] to commit changes

Now you can push this repository to the registry designated by its name or tag.

docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>

The image is then uploaded and available for use by your teammates and/or the community.
